# todo
- [use KaTex](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50892278/2352867)
- floating TOC?
    + would have to disable on small enough screens
    + or, instead/as well, that thing where the section headers glue to the top of the screen while scrolling? or is that just too flashy...
- rewrite CSS from scratch
    + update the sass plugin too? keep on getting warnings that it's been deprecated
