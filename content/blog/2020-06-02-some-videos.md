This is a very short post just to say that I've started uploading some maths-related videos to my YouTube page. At the moment there's a talk I recently gave at a graduate seminar about [connections and curvature from the point of view of somebody trying to avoid differential geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-fVcTSjrGT6ZQky9HoFVyiWgZwhc0ZZ), and a series I've been working on called [Nice Analytic Sheaves For All](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-fVcTSjrGSrMHbNcPpdbhNFbCU-FXVL) which aims to discuss motivations for coherence conditions of complex-analytic sheaves from various points of view. Hopefully there will be more updates to the latter soon!
