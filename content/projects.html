  <h4 class="mt3">Current projects</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collaborative English translations of maths papers, mainly Grothendieck's <a href="https://github.com/ryankeleti/ega" >EGA</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If I ever have spare time, I sometimes try to LaTeX up old papers (using a combination of OCR and manual labour). Any that I do will be <a href="https://github.com/thosgood/latex-remasters">on GitHub</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3251" >LaTeX support</a> for the Matrix client <a href="https://about.riot.im" >Riot</a>, so it can better function as a modern replacement for IRC rooms. There is currently a beta build of Riot with LaTeX support at <a href="https://pigeon.digital" >pigeon.digital</a>. There is also a Mathematics community <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+mathematics:matrix.org"><code>+mathematics:matrix.org</code></a> (a curated list of rooms, such as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org"><code>#math.CT:matrix.org</code></a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Some sort of categorical translation theory, and a software implementation, that builds on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11041.pdf">DisCoCat stuff by Bradley, Lewis, Master, and Thielman</a>.
      The aim is to restrict interest to just 'mathematical language' (i.e. some minimal amount of language necessary for the writing of mathematical papers), where things are much more well-behaved.
      With this, one can write a paper using a specified dictionary, resulting in something which, although somewhat dry to read, can have guaranteed translations into a bunch of other languages.
      A working demo is in progress, as well as an explanation of the theory behind (see <a href="https://thosgood.com/blog/2019/11/07/categorical-translation.html">here</a>).
