      <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3251" >LaTeX support</a> for the Matrix client <a href="https://about.riot.im" >Riot</a>, so it can better function as a modern replacement for IRC rooms. There is currently a beta build of Riot with LaTeX support at <a href="https://www.pigeon.digital" >pigeon.digital</a>. There is also a Mathematics community <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+mathematics:matrix.org" class="link underline black-80 courier f6">+mathematics:matrix.org</a> (a curated list of rooms, such as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#math.CT:matrix.org" class="link underline black-80 courier f6"><span>#math.CT:matrix.org</span></a>).
