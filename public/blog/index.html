    This blog is a mainly collection of notes of things that I'm trying to understand. The posts are often nothing more than summaries of various textbooks, papers, and nLab pages, but collated, (over)simplified, and reordered to be more easily understood by e.g. me.

        <p>Finally, I find myself with enough motivation to start writing the last part to this series. It’s been a while, but hopefully nobody has actually been waiting… This is where we will finally see some of the exciting applications of (co)ends, including tensor products, geometric realisation, and Day convolution. One reason I’ve got around to writing this post is because coends (or, really, cowedges) appeared to me recently in a tweet about Stokes’ theorem, which I found pretty neat indeed — more details can be found in <a href="/blog/2019/09/04/stokes-coend.html">this post</a>.</p>

        <p>For category theorists, the idea that “everything is a Kan extension” is a familiar one, as is the slightly more abstract version “everything is a (co)end”. For differential geometers, the idea that “everything is Stokes’ theorem” is sort of the equivalent adage. In an entirely typical turn of events, it seems that these two seemingly unrelated aphorisms can be linked together, as I found out today on Twitter.</p>

It is very easy, especially as a PhD student, I think, to become disillusioned with maths, the work that one can do, and academia as a whole. I realised only the other day, after talking to my family, some of the things that can contribute towards this.

        <p>In my thesis, switching between vector bundles and principal <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{GL}_r</script>-bundles has often made certain problems easier (or harder) to understand.
Due to my innate fear of all things differentially geometric, I often prefer working with principal bundles, and since reading Stephen Sontz’s (absolutely fantastic) book <a href="https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783319147642">Principal Bundles — The Classical Case</a>, I’ve really grown quite fond of bundles, especially when you start talking about all the lovely <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{B}G</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}G</script> things therein<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Point is, I haven’t posted anything in forever, and one of my supervisor’s strong pedagogical beliefs is that <em>‘affine vector spaces should be understood as <script type="math/tex">G</script>-torsors, where <script type="math/tex">G</script> is the underlying vector space acting via translation’</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> which makes a nice short topic of discussion, whence this post.</p>

Both of them seemed to be some sort of quotienting/equivalence-class-like action, so why not do them at the same time?
What different roles were played by each step?</p>

        <p>A motto of category theory is that ‘Kan extensions are everywhere’. As a
simplification of this, ‘(co)limits are in a lot of places’. By rephrasing
the definition of a limit we end up with something that looks invitingly
generalisable. This is how we can stumble across the idea of a
<strong>weighted limit</strong>. In this post I’m going to assume that you are already
convinced of the usefulness and omnipresence of limits and not talk too much
(if at all) about why they are interesting in their own right.</p>
