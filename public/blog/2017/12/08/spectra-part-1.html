<p>I have been reading recently about spectra and their use in defining cohomology theories. Something that came up quite a lot was the idea of <strong><script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras</strong>, which I knew roughly corresponded to some commutative version of <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras, but beyond that I knew nothing. After some enlightening discussions with one of my supervisors, I feel like I’m starting to see how the ideas of spectra, <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script>-algebras, and operads all fit together. In an attempt to solidify this understanding and pinpoint any difficulties, I’m going to try to write up what I ‘understand’ so far.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>The rough idea is to study loop spaces and consider their ‘generalisation’ as homotopy pullbacks, then to define <strong>spectrum objects</strong> in stable <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-categories.  We also consider why we can call <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras ‘generalised loop spaces’.
Then we will have a look at the <script type="math/tex">E_\infty</script> and <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script> operads and try to describe the algebras over them, before seeing how this is linked to the idea of <strong>spectra</strong> (spectrum objects in the category of topological spaces).</p>

<p>After this, I might do a series on the uses of spectra, like ‘nice’ cohomology theories in <script type="math/tex">(\infty,1)</script>-topoi, and ‘brave new geometry’ in the framework of Toën and Vezzosi’s homotopical algebraic geometry.</p>

<p><em>There probably won’t be many references or pictures to begin with, but I will try to come back and add some at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future.</em></p>

<h2>Loop spaces</h2>

<h3>Classical approach</h3>

<p>Given some topological space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, we have many good reasons to be interested in its fundamental group. That is, we are interested in what happens to <strong>loops</strong> (maps from <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> to <script type="math/tex">X</script>) in our space when we consider everything up to homotopy. With this in mind, we define the <strong>(pointed) loop space <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> at some point <script type="math/tex">x\in X</script></strong> as the mapping space</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^1,(X,x)\big)</script>

<p>which has a base point given by the constant map to <script type="math/tex">x</script>, and where we consider <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> as a pointed space with some (fixed) base point <script type="math/tex">s\in S^1</script> (e.g. embed <script type="math/tex">S^1</script> into <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2</script> and let <script type="math/tex">s=(1,0)</script>).</p>

<p>Now, by definition, we have an isomorphism of groups <script type="math/tex">\pi_0\Omega(X,x)\cong\pi_1(X,x)</script>, since elements of the latter are classes of homotopy-equivalent paths, which are the same as classes of points of the former, where we identify points if there is a path between them.
This suggestive isomorphism makes us wonder if there are ‘higher’ loop spaces <script type="math/tex">\Omega^i(X,x)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\pi_i(X,x)\cong\pi_0\Omega^i(X,x)</script>.
The answer is, as you would hope, yes.
In fact, we can just iterate loop spaces to obtain such objects: we define the <strong><script type="math/tex">i</script>-fold loop space</strong> as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega^i(X,x):=\Omega\big(\Omega^{i-1}(X,x)\big).</script>

<h3>Suspensions and smashing</h3>

<p>This definition of higher loop spaces might be a tad surprising in so far as one might have expected ‘higher loops’ to be defined as maps from ‘higher spheres’, and thus to have defined the <script type="math/tex">i</script>-fold loop space as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Omega^i(X,x):=\mathrm{Map}_*\big(S^i,(X,x)\big).</script>

<p>It is a beautiful convenience that these two proposed definitions agree, and the story goes as follows.</p>

<p>The category <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> of pointed topological spaces admits the structure of a symmetric monoidal category,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> where the product is the <strong>smash product</strong>, given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">X\wedge Y:=\frac{X\times Y}{X\vee Y}</script>

<p>and where <script type="math/tex">X\vee Y</script> is the <strong>wedge sum</strong>, given by identifying base points.
It would be tantamount to a crime to not put in any pictures here, so below are some examples.</p>

<p><strong>INSERT PICTURES</strong></p>

<p>In fact, <script type="math/tex">\mathsf{Top}_*</script> is a <em>closed</em> symmetric monoidal category:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> we have the adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\wedge\dashv\mathsf{Top}_*)</script>, and thus the natural isomorphism</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge Y, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\mathsf{Top}_*(Y,Z)).</script>

<p>In particular then, taking <script type="math/tex">Y=S^1</script>, we see that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(X\wedge S^1, Z)\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(X,\Omega(Z,z))</script>

<p>naturally in both <script type="math/tex">X</script> and <script type="math/tex">Z</script>, so defining the <strong>(reduced)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> suspension</strong> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> as <script type="math/tex">\Sigma X:=X\wedge S^1</script> gives us an adjunction <script type="math/tex">(\Sigma\dashv\Omega)</script>.
But now we notice that <em>if we can show that <script type="math/tex">\Sigma S^i\simeq S^{i+1}</script></em> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathsf{Top}_*(S^i,(X,x))\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^{i-1},\Omega(X,x))\cong\ldots\cong\mathsf{Top}_*(S^1,\Omega^i(X,x))</script>

<p>whence the two possible definitions of higher loop spaces agree.</p>

<p>We can actually prove a stronger statement: <script type="math/tex">S^i\wedge S^j\simeq S^{i+j}</script>.
To ‘see’ this, we consider <script type="math/tex">S^i</script> as a cell complex with cells <script type="math/tex">e^0\sqcup e^i</script>.
Then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S^i\wedge S^j\simeq\frac{e^0\sqcup e^j\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^{i+j}}{e^0\sqcup e^i\sqcup e^j}\simeq e^0\sqcup e^{i+j}.</script>

<h3>Homotopy pullbacks</h3>

<p>We claim that the loop space construction can also be described as the homotopy pullback of <script type="math/tex">X</script> along the base point <script type="math/tex">x\colon*\to X</script>. That is, we want to realise</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
    A &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \lrcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &X
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>as the loop space <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script> we defined previously.
But now we use a ‘simple’ trick:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> replace the point with the contractible space <script type="math/tex">\\\{\gamma\colon[0,1]\to X \mid \gamma(0)=x\\\}</script>, and map this into <script type="math/tex">X</script> by sending <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> to <script type="math/tex">\gamma(1)</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">A</script> is exactly the space of maps <script type="math/tex">D^1\to X</script> based at <script type="math/tex">x</script> (i.e with <script type="math/tex">\gamma(0)=x</script>) such that <script type="math/tex">\gamma(1)=x</script> as well, and this is exactly <script type="math/tex">\Omega(X,x)</script>.</p>

<p>Dually, the (reduced) suspension can be realised as the homotopy pushout</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ccc}
    X &\to &* \\
    \downarrow & \ulcorner&\downarrow \\
    * &\to &B
\end{array} %]]></script>

<p>or, said in a different way,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> as the mapping cone of the terminal map <script type="math/tex">X\to *</script>.</p>

<h3>Sneak peek at <script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras</h3>

<p>In one of Stasheff’s theses, in the 60s, he formalised the idea of algebras that behave ‘like loop spaces’ in that they have a multiplication structure that is only associative <em>up to some higher homotopies</em>. These are called <strong><script type="math/tex">A_\infty</script>-algebras</strong>, and there are plenty of classic introductions to them in their own right. The ‘most classic’ is probably <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910179">Keller, Bernhard (2001). Introduction to A-infinity algebras and modules</a></em>, which also describes (in §2.2) what I’m going to briefly sketch out below (and will cover in more detail in the future): how loop spaces are ‘almost associative algebras’.</p>

<p>Given two loops, <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2</script> in <script type="math/tex">X</script>, we can define their ‘product’ <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2</script> as their composition: we ‘do/follow/trace out’ the loop <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1</script> followed immediately by the loop <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2</script>. Clearly we have some identity element under this product, as well as inverses, and associativity is ‘obvious’ because following the first loop then the second, and <em>then</em> the third is the same as following the first, and <em>then</em> the second and the third, right?</p>

<p>I mean, obviously here there is some caveat so that the actual answer is <em>no</em>, but I think that making this mistake is in some way a good thing, because it means that we’re thinking homotopically without maybe even realising it.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> The problem with associativity comes from the fact that we have picked some model of <script type="math/tex">S^1</script>, namely <script type="math/tex">[0,1]</script>, and so our composed loops have to respect this. That is, we can’t just define <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2</script> as the obvious map <script type="math/tex">[0,2]\to X</script>; we have to scale the paths so that <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\colon[0,1]\to X</script>. This is easy enough: we do <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1(t/2)</script> for <script type="math/tex">0\leqslant t\leqslant\frac12</script> and <script type="math/tex">\gamma_2((t+1)/2)</script> for <script type="math/tex">\frac12\leqslant t\leqslant1</script>.
But the problem then arises that <script type="math/tex">(\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2)\cdot\gamma_3\neq\gamma_1\cdot(\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_2)</script> (this might be better explained in the pictures below), although they are clearly homotopic. Then, however, we have a similar problem when we want to look at <script type="math/tex">\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2\cdot\gamma_3\cdot\gamma_4</script>, but now we have many<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> ways of bracketing this. All possible ways will be homotopic, of course, but there is a lot of structure contained in this information of <em>how</em> the different choices are homotopic, and if we can somehow remember all of this then maybe we will gain something from it.</p>
