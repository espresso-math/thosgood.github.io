Finally, I find myself with enough motivation to start writing the last part to this series. It's been a while, but hopefully nobody has actually been waiting... This is where we will finally see some of the exciting applications of (co)ends, including tensor products, geometric realisation, and Day convolution. One reason I've got around to writing this post is because coends (or, really, cowedges) appeared to me recently in a tweet about Stokes' theorem, which I found pretty neat indeed --- more details can be found in [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-09-04-stokes-coend %}).

For a refresher on all the definitions, you can check out the two previous parts in this series (the links are at the top).

## Tensor products

### Examples

## Geometric realisation

## Day convolution

### Monoid algebra

## Profunctors

- tensor products
- examples of tensor products
- geometric realisation
- day convolution
- monoid algebra <-> day convolution analogy
- profunctors! composition is via coends, and this looks like $$\exists$$ for composition of relations
